**Epic 4: Payment & Fee Management System**
**Goal:** Enable seamless fee collection through Razorpay integration with installment support and automated parent notifications for outstanding payments.

**Epic 5: Analytics Dashboard & Reporting**
**Goal:** Deliver actionable insights through role-based dashboards showing student performance, attendance trends, revenue metrics, and operational analytics.

**Rationale for Epic Sequencing:**
