5. Environment variable management for local development and production deployment
6. Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, Husky) configured and enforcing standards
7. Error monitoring with Sentry integrated and capturing application errors
8. Health check endpoint (/api/health) returning system status and database connectivity

## Story 1.2: Multi-Role Authentication System

As an **Institute Owner**,
I want to create and manage user accounts with different access levels,
so that I can control who can access different features of the platform.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User registration system supporting 6 roles: Owner, Academic Head, Teacher, Admin Staff, Student, Parent
2. JWT-based authentication with secure token generation and validation
3. Role-based access control middleware protecting API endpoints
4. Password reset functionality via email with secure token expiration
5. User profile management allowing basic information updates
6. Account activation system with email verification for new users
7. Session management with configurable expiration and refresh token capability
8. Audit log tracking user authentication events and role changes

## Story 1.3: Institute Setup and Configuration

As an **Institute Owner**,
I want to configure my institute's basic information and settings,
so that the platform reflects my institution's identity and operational preferences.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Institute profile creation with name, address, contact information, and branding
2. Academic year and semester/term configuration with date ranges
3. Subject and course category setup with hierarchical organization
4. Fee structure templates with installment options and late fee policies
5. Communication preferences including WhatsApp Business API credentials
6. Regional language preference selection (Hindi/English for MVP)
7. Time zone and business hours configuration for automated notifications
8. Basic institute dashboard showing setup completion percentage and next steps

## Story 1.4: User Management Interface

As an **Institute Owner**,
I want to invite and manage all users (teachers, staff, students, parents) in one interface,
so that I can efficiently control access and maintain accurate user records.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User invitation system sending email invites with role-specific registration links
2. Bulk user import via CSV upload with template download and validation
3. User listing with search, filter, and sorting capabilities by role and status
4. Individual user profile editing with role modification and account status controls
