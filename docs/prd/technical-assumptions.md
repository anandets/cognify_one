# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
**Rationale:** Single repository for MVP simplicity, easier deployment, shared components, and faster development cycles. This approach reduces complexity for small team and enables atomic deployments.

## Service Architecture: Monolith with Modular Structure
**Architecture Decision:** Start with modular monolith deployed as single application with clear internal module boundaries. This approach provides:
- **Faster MVP development** with single codebase and deployment
- **Lower operational complexity** with single server/database setup
- **Easy debugging and testing** in development environment
- **Future microservices migration path** through well-defined module boundaries

**Rationale:** Given our 6-month MVP timeline and lean team, a monolith provides fastest time-to-market while maintaining code organization for future scalability.

## Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration Testing
**Testing Strategy:** Focus on automated testing that provides high confidence with minimal maintenance overhead:
- **Unit Tests:** Core business logic and utility functions (80% coverage target)
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoints and database operations (critical path coverage)
- **E2E Tests:** Key user journeys on mobile PWA (smoke tests only for MVP)
- **Manual Testing:** UI/UX validation and device compatibility testing

**Rationale:** Balanced approach providing confidence without slowing development velocity.

## Technology Stack (Lean & Battle-Tested)

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and component reusability
- **Next.js 14** for full-stack framework with built-in PWA support
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI development and consistent styling
- **React Query** for server state management and caching
- **PWA with Service Worker** for offline functionality

### Backend
- **Node.js with Express** for API server (leveraging team JavaScript expertise)
- **Prisma ORM** for database operations with TypeScript integration
- **JWT Authentication** with secure token management
- **Winston** for logging and monitoring

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** for primary data storage (ACID compliance, JSON support, mature ecosystem)
- **Redis** for session management and caching (optional for MVP, add if needed)

### External Services & Integrations
- **Razorpay** for payment processing (Indian market leader)
- **WhatsApp Business API** for parent communication
- **AWS SES** for email notifications
- **Twilio** for SMS communications
- **Cloudinary** for media storage and optimization

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Vercel** for hosting and deployment (seamless Next.js integration)
- **PostgreSQL on Railway/PlanetScale** for database hosting
- **AWS S3** for file storage (documents, videos)
- **Cloudflare** for CDN and performance optimization

### Development & Operations
- **Git** with GitHub for version control
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality
- **Husky** for pre-commit hooks
- **Sentry** for error monitoring

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Decisions

### Mobile Strategy
- **PWA First:** Progressive Web App providing native app experience without app store complexity
- **Responsive Design:** Single codebase serving both mobile and desktop
- **Offline Storage:** LocalStorage and IndexedDB for offline functionality
- **Push Notifications:** Web push notifications for engagement

### Security Assumptions
- **HTTPS Everywhere:** All communication encrypted in transit
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive data stored in environment configuration
- **Rate Limiting:** API protection against abuse and DDoS
- **Input Validation:** Server-side validation for all user inputs

### Performance Assumptions
- **Code Splitting:** Lazy loading for non-critical components
- **Image Optimization:** Automatic image compression and format selection
- **Caching Strategy:** Aggressive caching for static assets, smart caching for dynamic data
- **Bundle Size:** Target <500KB initial bundle for fast loading

### Scalability Path
- **Database Optimization:** Proper indexing and query optimization
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Application designed for multiple server instances
- **Microservices Migration:** Clear module boundaries for future service extraction
- **CDN Strategy:** Global content distribution for multimedia content
