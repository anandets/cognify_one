# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver integrated LMS + Student Management + Communication in one platform

## Background Context
The Indian EdTech B2B market presents a ₹12,188 Crores opportunity with 85% of institutions struggling with integration challenges across multiple tools. Tier-2 coaching institutes (80% underserved) need an affordable, unified platform that combines learning management, student operations, and parent communication. Current solutions like BYJU'S, Unacademy focus on B2C, while B2B players like Teachmint lack comprehensive integration and India-specific features. Our MVP targets this gap with mobile-first, offline-capable platform designed for Indian coaching centers.
