## 🎯 **Actionable Recommendations**

### **🔥 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Week 1-2)**

#### 1. **Technical Foundation**
```yaml
priority: CRITICAL
tasks:
  - Create technical architecture document
  - Define core technology stack (Backend: Node.js/Python, Frontend: React/Vue, Database: PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
  - Establish development environment setup
  - Design database schema for multi-tenant architecture
```

#### 2. **Security Framework**
```yaml
priority: HIGH
tasks:
  - Document authentication/authorization strategy
  - Plan data privacy compliance (India DPDP Act 2023, GDPR)
  - Define API security standards
  - Create security checklist for development teams
```

### **📊 SHORT-TERM (Month 1)**

#### 3. **MVP Definition & Roadmap**
```yaml
priority: HIGH
tasks:
  - Define MVP scope (focus on core LMS module)
  - Create 3-month development roadmap
  - Establish technical feasibility proof-of-concept
  - Plan integration points between modules
```

#### 4. **Performance Planning**
```yaml
priority: MEDIUM
tasks:
  - Define non-functional requirements
  - Plan CDN strategy for India market
  - Design offline-first mobile architecture
  - Create scalability benchmarks
```

### **🚀 MEDIUM-TERM (Months 2-3)**

#### 5. **Implementation Readiness**
```yaml
priority: MEDIUM
tasks:
  - Establish CI/CD pipeline using BMAD workflows
  - Create development team onboarding process
  - Set up monitoring and observability framework
  - Plan beta testing strategy with coaching centers
