- **Momentum Index:** Composite of submission timeliness, forum velocity, quiz recency.
- **Social Graph Density:** Collaboration centrality & inclusion health metric.
- **Intervention Impact Tracing:** Pre/post effect of nudges or study group formation.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Cohort Operations Toolkit
- Automated onboarding drip (multi-channel)
- Schedule optimizer (resolves global timezones, suggests majority-fit windows)
- Resource Pack deployer (bulk attach readings / case files at sprint start)
- Checkpoint gating (unlock next unit on reflection submission)
- Milestone Board (competency progression visualization across cohort)

#### üöÄ Advanced Cohort Innovations
- **Dynamic Pacing Engine:** Adjusts recommended pace based on aggregate progress variance.
- **Cohort Health AI Sentinel:** Flags burnout risk, overload clusters, attrition likelihood.
- **Collaborative OKR Layer:** Cohort-level Objectives with progress contributions by activity.
- **Event Generator:** AI suggests timely workshops (e.g., ‚ÄúConcept X confusion spike ‚Üí run micro clinic‚Äù).
- **Cross-Cohort Knowledge Exchange:** Rotational synergy sessions & aggregated insight digest.

#### üåü 5 Unique Community & Cohort Blue Ocean Features
**1. Adaptive Community Layout Engine:** Personalized feed modules (Q&A focus vs project focus) adapting to user role, goals, and current learning friction points.

**2. Knowledge Graph Navigator:** Interactive concept map auto-built from course content + discussions + assessments; supports path simulation ("if I master X & Y, unlock Z").

**3. Timezone-Optimized Collaboration Scheduler:** Predictive participation model recommends best global sync windows & auto-suggests async alternatives.

**4. Silent Learner Mode:** AI-curated daily digest & passive engagement score; targeted micro-engagement prompts to re-activate low-noise learners without overwhelming them.

**5. Ethical AI Moderation Triad:** Transparent tri-layer (AI pre-screen ‚Üí Peer review queue ‚Üí Staff adjudication) + bias & false positive analytics dashboard.

### Completion Note
This document now captures a holistic, multi-layer feature universe for Cognify spanning LMS, ERP, CRM, Community, Cohort Learning, Stakeholder Relations, Alumni, Corporate Training, Gamification, and AI augmentation. Next recommended steps: (1) Prioritize into MVP / Phase roadmap, (2) Define domain-driven bounded contexts, (3) Establish cross-cutting platform services (Identity, Messaging, Analytics, AI Inference, Payments), (4) Draft initial data model & event taxonomy.
