## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Launch MVP within 6 months to capture tier-2 coaching institute market
- Deliver integrated LMS + Student Management + Communication in one platform
- Achieve <14 days time-to-first-value for new customers
- Enable 100+ students per institute with mobile-first experience
- Generate ₹17 Crores revenue in Year 1 with 150+ customers
- Establish foundation for modular expansion into ERP, CRM, and Analytics

### Background Context
The Indian EdTech B2B market presents a ₹12,188 Crores opportunity with 85% of institutions struggling with integration challenges across multiple tools. Tier-2 coaching institutes (80% underserved) need an affordable, unified platform that combines learning management, student operations, and parent communication. Current solutions like BYJU'S, Unacademy focus on B2C, while B2B players like Teachmint lack comprehensive integration and India-specific features. Our MVP targets this gap with mobile-first, offline-capable platform designed for Indian coaching centers.
